Sports-Pool-Maker
=================
Designed specifically for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Tournement, but should be able to work with any 4 round tournement, it can save new tournements and support input for a bracket corresponding with a person. The brackets are then compared with an updatable master bracket to calculate a score for each person with a submitted bracket. It was developed on a mac and may have limited functionality on PCs.
