Sports-Pool-Maker
=================
Designed specifically for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Tournement, but should be able to work with any 4 round tournement, it can save new tournements and support input for a bracket corresponding with a person. The brackets are then compared with an updatable master bracket to calculate a score for each person with a submitted bracket. All files from the program are saved to the "files" folder. In order to run the program the .jar file must be in the same directory as that folder. It was developed on a mac and may have limited functionality on PCs.
